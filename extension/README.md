# Winning Writing Coach — Chrome extension

A Chrome side panel that runs the inline cold-email critic against the bundled rule library, with one-click import of the active Gmail compose draft.

Same skills, same prompt-cached rule library, same Accept / Reject / Refine flow as the [Coach UI](../ui/coach.html) — but it lives in the side panel next to Gmail.

```

`rules/` is a snapshot. To pick up rule edits, copy from the repo root again (see [Updating rules](#updating-rules)).

## Install (unpacked, personal use)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle **Developer mode** in the top right
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Pick this `extension/` folder
5. Click the extension's puzzle-piece icon in the toolbar → **Pin** it for easy access
6. Click the icon → side panel opens
7. Open **Settings** in the panel, paste your `sk-ant-...` API key, pick a model (Sonnet 4.6 recommended)

The key is stored in `chrome.storage.local` and never leaves your machine. API calls go browser-direct to `api.anthropic.com`.

## Use

**From Gmail:**
1. Open a Gmail compose box (Compose, Reply, or Forward)
2. Click the extension icon → side panel opens
3. Click **Import from Gmail compose** → the draft body fills the textarea
4. Click **Critique** → ~8s later, severity-coded annotations appear with the rule that fired each one

**From anywhere:**
1. Open the side panel
2. Paste a draft into the textarea
3. Click **Critique**

**Refining:**
- The chat under the critique takes plain-English instructions ("cut 30 words", "move the ask earlier", "what's wrong with the opener?")
- Rewrites update the working draft; ask questions and you get a 1-3 sentence evaluation
- Click **Re-critique** after a rewrite to flag what's left

## What it does NOT do (yet)

- Inline highlights directly inside Gmail's compose body (the panel is the surface for now)
- Send-button interception with the pre-send checklist
- Reply-thread context (the import grabs the body only)
- Auto-sync rules from GitHub
- Voice file editing in-panel

These are tracked on the roadmap and will follow as the personal+free path solidifies.

## Updating rules

`rules/` is a snapshot of the repo's `points/` and `skills/` directories. When those change, refresh the snapshot:

```powershell
# from the repo root
$src = "."; $dst = ".\extension\rules"
Copy-Item "$src\points\*.md" "$dst\points\" -Force
foreach ($s in @("em-dash-killer","jargon-killer","adverb-killer","be-specific","show-dont-tell","tell-them-something-new","warmth-and-competence","headline-as-claim","kill-redundancy","fun-angle","pick-a-lane","irrelevant-detail-killer")) {
  Copy-Item "$src\skills\$s\SKILL.md" "$dst\skills\$s\SKILL.md" -Force
}
```

Then click **Reload** on the extension card in `chrome://extensions`.

(On macOS / Linux: `cp -r points/*.md extension/rules/points/` and a similar loop for the skills.)

## Why a snapshot, not a live fetch?

Extensions can only load files inside their own package. Live-fetching the rules from GitHub raw URLs would work but introduces a remote dependency and refresh logic that v1 doesn't need. The snapshot keeps the extension self-contained and offline-capable. A future version may add an opt-in `?source=github` mode.

## Architecture notes

- Same `runInlineCritic` and `runRefinementTurn` as the [Coach UI](../ui/) — the side panel is a thin shell.
- `skill-loader.js` detects `chrome.runtime.getURL` to pick its URL strategy. Without it (e.g., serving `sidepanel.html` over plain HTTP for preview testing), it falls back to relative paths.
- API calls use prompt caching with `cache_control: ephemeral` on the rule-library block, so repeat critiques within 5 minutes pay ~10% of the input cost on those tokens.
- The content script uses two stable Gmail selectors — `div[role="textbox"][aria-label*="body" i]` and `input[name="subjectbox"]`. Gmail's DOM shifts over time; if Import stops finding the compose box, those selectors are where to look first.

## Known sharp edges

- If the model returns suggestions like `(delete — and replace with X)` instead of `(delete)`, the verbose parenthetical gets inserted literally on Accept. Same v1 wart as the Coach UI; fixable by widening the delete-pattern regex.
- The compose-body extractor walks `<div>` and `<br>` into newlines. Gmail's HTML signature blocks and quoted replies come through as part of the body — strip them in the textarea before critiquing if they're noise.
- Side panel layout is tuned for ~360-480px width. Narrower panels reflow but the rule pills can wrap awkwardly.
